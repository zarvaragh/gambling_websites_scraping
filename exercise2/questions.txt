General
-------

This is an intermediate Python coding exercise. In order to properly solve this,
you would need some understanding on how to optimize your code.

In the same folder as this question is the file data.json. That is the input that you will use for this exercise.

This exercise is composed of 3 parts, and is separated to 1, 2 & 3 below. While there are 3 parts,
we are only expecting one Python script as your submission.

Parts 1 & 2 would need to be answered by a single Python script.
Part 3 can be an explanation, or you may submit a Python script that illustrates your point.

Given the file data.json as your input, perform the following:

1. Create a CSV file, with a header, that contains the fullname, age, address and occupation.
	- Note: fullname is in "Firstname Lastname: format)
2. Generate statistics (in JSON format) using the following criteria and answers the following questions:
	- Use the lastname as the key.
	- How many people have the same last name?
	- How many different ages are there?
	- How many different occupations?
	
	- The output should look like:
		{
			'lastname1': {
				'count': number_of_people,
				'age': {
					'age1': occurence,
					'age2': occurence
				},
				'address': {
					'address1': occurence,
					'address2': occurence
				},
				'occupation': {
					'job1': occurence
				}
			}
		}

3. Imagine you are now given 20 JSON inputs. How will you minimize the runtime for the above tasks?


Submission format
-----------------

Please submit your Python script that produces an answer to parts 1 & 2. It must be compatible with Python 3.5 and higher.

For part 3, you may submit an explanation, or another Python script with an explanation to illustrate your point.
